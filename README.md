# Pomodoro Timer in Python

This Python script implements a Pomodoro Timer, a time management technique developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The Pomodoro Technique involves breaking work into intervals (traditionally 25 minutes in length) separated by short breaks. 

Visual notifications are provided at the beginning and end of each Pomodoro and break, helping users stay focused and on track.


## Usage:

Run the script.

Start the timer, and focus on your work during each Pomodoro interval.

Take short breaks between Pomodoros to rest and recharge.

## Dependencies:

Python 3.12

## Getting Started:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```python
git clone https://github.com/straznikit/pomodoro-timer
```
2. Run the script and start generating and managing your passwords securely.
